            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen of late wee met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had ſome conference of the preſent affaires of the State, but ſpecially of the fall of <hi>Philodoxos:</hi> you did ſeeme to wonder that I ſhould be ſo confident that his end ſhould bee no other then it fell out to be; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I did confirme the ſame unto you, as well by Reaſon as by Authority, taken out of the Hiſtories both of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and moderne times, yet you were ſtill of opinion that <hi>Philodoxos</hi> was ſo deeply ſcrued in his <hi>Princes</hi> favour, that misfortune could not ſhake him; and did deſire me to ſhew you ſome Preſidents of ſuch as had taſted of the like grace and favour as hee did, and that came to the like end as he did, and withall what the cauſes were why
<pb facs="tcp:154392:8"/>
I ſhould bee ſo confident that Ruine and Deſtruction muſt needes be the end of him: of which your requeſt or command rather, being ever mindfull, I will firſt ſhew unto you out of the Treaſuries of times both ancient and moderne, ſome Examples of ſuch as have been highly honoured by their <hi>Princes,</hi> how they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Behold here a notable example of humane frailty, and a ſingular patterne for ſuch as are in grace and favour with their Princes, to put them in minde the higher they are, the more reverently and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively to carry themſelves; this man that was in the morning attended upon like an <hi>Emperour,</hi> in the evening was

thrown into priſon like a beggar; whom not long before the people adorned with Crownes of gold, not long after they bound with fetters of iron; whom as their Lord they honoured, they beate as their ſlave: whom they adored and ſacrificed unto as unto a God, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled and dragd unto death moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniouſly like a rogue; the ſame day that the Senate did him all the honour that they could, the people would have carbonaded him, and have pulled him in peices: this man that had ſo much that he could not deſire more, either of God or Man to make him happy whilſt hee lived, before hee dyed had ſo little that he had not wherewithall to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the hang-man; a notable pattern I ſay of humane frailty; yet more of this kinde will I ſhew unto you; In the pulling down of <hi>Sejanus, Tiberius</hi> uſed the aſſiſtance of <hi>Nevius Sertorius Macro,</hi> whom not long before hee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly made Commander of the Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Company: and the Senate concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo well of him, that by a decree they conferred all <hi>Sejanus</hi> his honours upon him; but hee being terrified by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample

that was ſo freſh in memory, refuſed to accept them; yet not long after it ſo happened that hee became exceeding powerfull, and applyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe wholy to <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyed how to make him <hi>Emperour</hi> after <hi>Tiberius,</hi> inſomuch that when <hi>Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> underſtood it,<note n="*" place="margin">15 Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientalem perſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ſolem illum ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probravit.</note> 15 <hi>hee upbraided him for abandoning the ſetting, and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the riſing Sunne;</hi> but <hi>Caligula</hi> in the end requited him for his good will, putting him together with his wife to death with <hi>Claudius Coeſar:</hi> the moſt powerfull men were his freed men, and amongſt them <hi>Narciſſus</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> whom he uſed to ſeverall purpoſes; the one as his Secretary to write his Letters, the other as his Orator to make his ſpeeches, whoſe ſervices hee requited by a decree of the Senate, not only with infinite treaſure, but with places of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Command: inſomuch that upon a time inquiring what the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was that his Treaſury was ſo emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: anſwer was made, that it would be full enough if that the money that was taken forth of it by <hi>Narciſſus</hi> and <hi>Pallas,</hi> were put into it; with theſe men

and their wives <hi>Claudius</hi> was ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured that he became rather their Servant then their Soveraigne: at their diſpoſall were all Honours, Armies, Pardons, and Puniſhments, inſomuch that <hi>Sextus Aurelius</hi> was uſed to call<note n="*" place="margin">16 Narciſſum dominum domini appellat.</note> 16 <hi>Narciſſus the maſter of his maſter;</hi> for as <hi>Iuvenal</hi> ſaith, unto <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſus Claudius</hi> denied nothing, nay ſpared not to kill his wife, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by him ſo to do; ſo that <hi>Dion</hi> affirmes hee was the moſt powerfull Man of that age, and of the age paſt, having a command over Princes, and Cityes, and Poſſeſſions amounting to more then foure thouſand Seſters. This man notwithſtanding as ſoone as <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> was dead, <hi>Agrippina</hi> the wife of <hi>Claudius,</hi> and <hi>Neros</hi> Mother put to death; ſo that though theſe kinde of men may peradventure during the lives of the Princes by whom they have beene raiſed, live in grace, yet ſeldome doe they eſcape the hands of their ſucceſſors.

and afterwards to be his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, though hee contracted with the Senate that for any offence paſt hee ſhould not be queſtioned; yet <hi>Nero</hi> obſerving how proudly hee caried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, exceeding the limits of a free man, grew in hatred with him, ſo that after that he had removed him from all places of Authority which <hi>Claudius</hi> had conferred upon him, having had indeed the Key of the Empire in his power, he was by <hi>Nero</hi> put to death; the exceſſive pride of this man is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this one paſſage: he being accuſed by <hi>Nero</hi> upon a time for words ſpoken, when hee heard the Libertines named that ſhould be his accuſers, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that at home hee never ſpoke word, but did all by ſignes and tokens; if the matter were ſhort, hee expreſt himſelfe either by his nod or by his hand; if long, by writing. In the next place, <hi>Tigellinus</hi> deſcended of meane Parentage, vitious in his youth, viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his age, who having by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt courſes, wherein hee grew ſo notorious, that be ſurpaſſed all the men of his time, crept into <hi>Neros</hi> favour, and

               </head>
               <p>IN the next place ſhall be ſhewed the Cauſes wherefore the proſperity of theſe men is but momentary; and why ruine is for the moſt part the end of them. The cauſes wherefore they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue not in proſperity, that I may briefly ſumme them up, are one or both of theſe. Either becauſe they doe obtaine their greatneſſe by wicked practiſes and diviſes, or that having duly attained unto it, they doe diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norably carry themſelves in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch offices as are committed to their charge.</p>
               <p>The Counſels of men, and the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of their lives are different, and have different ſucceſſe, according to the counſell of him that adviſeth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth: if hee adviſeth good things
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:154392:26"/>
to a good end, the ſucceſſe is good; if contrarywiſe, it is bad; ſo in the world there are divers callings, according to the diverſitie of degrees, ſexes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, and every calling different from another; ſome of us are men, ſome women; ſome are fathers, others children; ſome Lords and free men, other ſervants and Miniſters; ſome rule and governe, others ſerve and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey; ſome are ſeparate for the ſervice of God, others for ſecular imployment. To conclude:<note n="*" place="margin">36 Quiſque peculiari munere devinctus eſt.</note> 36 <hi>Every one is called to one calling or other,</hi> and we may not believe that this commeth to paſſe by chance, or by the will of man, but by the divine providence of God, who hath appointed to every one both noble and ignoble, rich and poore, a certaine calling before they were borne. <hi>David, Cyrus, Jeremy,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, were all of them called by God in his appointed time to a peculiar office; ſome to beare the office of a King, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a Prieſt, others to other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. So God in the beginning by the eternall decree of his divine providence made every one of us; firſt man, then
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:154392:27"/>
woman; Then gave him a charge to look to this or that Countrey; no man is free or called to be idle, for we may not think that God ſo neglecteth any one as that he ſhould not put to a help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand, and act his part upon the ſtage of the world, for the publike good; there is no man I ſay, no not the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible man in the world, on whom he hath not impoſed ſome charge or other, which although for a time it may ſeem but mean, yet God oftentimes in the duſt ſhews his power, and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. <hi>David for many yeeres was a poor ſhepheard,</hi> and lived in Exile, yet at length became a king of kings.<note n="*" place="margin">37 Contemp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tus à fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribus.</note> 37 <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph was hated of his brethren,</hi>

Seeing then that there is nothing more certain then that every one is called by God in his appointed time, we ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his good will and pleaſure, and not to run before we are called of him. Therefore in what condition or ſtate of life we are, we ought to live to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God and the good of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which if wee neglect we labour
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:154392:27"/>
in vaine, to our owne deſtruction; this is therefore the firſt cauſe why thoſe that thruſt themſelves into buſineſſes out of their calling, and take upon them things beyond their ſtrength, incurre the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred both of God and men; for thoſe men never dream of God or goodneſſe, but <note n="*" place="margin">40 Per aequa &amp; iniqua gratiam principis acquirere.</note> 40 <hi>ſeek by fraud and bribery, calumnies and all other wicked practiſes</hi> to attain to their ends.</p>
               <p>Firſt, how to procure their Princes favour, then how to attain the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt place about him, by ruinating ſuch as ſtand in their way.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:154392:28"/>
and common weale; ſo did <hi>Seianus</hi> of whom wee have ſpoken of before; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt many other of his wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, that he might remove <hi>Denſus</hi> his competitor, made love unto his wife, lay with her, and what with promiſe of marriage, and in putting her in hope to be his conſort in the Empire, cauſed her to have a principall hand in her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands death. So did <hi>Pallas</hi> by his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery win the love of <hi>Agrippina</hi> the wife of <hi>Claudius Ceſar</hi> and mother of <hi>Nero,</hi> and all to keep his former greatneſs; It is a thing moſt odious and abominable in Courtiers, that they ſhould not think of any other meanes to purchaſe their Princes favour, then by commending unto them the beauty and comely fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mens wives and Siſters, thereby to ſet their affections on fire, and binde him unto them; it is an odious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ominable thing likewiſe, yet a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon thing in this age, and in all times hath been, for ſuch as follow the courts of Princes, to obtain or retain their Princes favour, to put in execution any wicked act, if ſo be that he command them: So did <hi>Ioab</hi> readily put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the command of King <hi>David,</hi> and ſlew <hi>Vriah;</hi> ſo did Cardinall <hi>Woolſey</hi> allow of the divorce of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and Queen <hi>Katherine,</hi> and all that he might revenge the wrong that he ſuppoſed was offered him by the Emperour. When <hi>Nero</hi> took diſtaſt againſt his ſometimes beloved <hi>Octavia,</hi> his Courtiers preſently, eſpecially thoſe of the nobility, fearing their wives, they commended <hi>Actes</hi> unto him, and in this buſineſſe <hi>Annaeus Serenus</hi> a great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of <hi>Senacae's</hi> had a great hand, he made love unto her, covered and took upon himſelf the extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the yong Prince, and ſuch gifts as the <hi>Prince</hi> had beſtowed upon her ſecretly, he avouched to be his openly. But men that deal in buſineſſes of this kinde, are for the moſt part falſe and perfidious; for when they have once tranſgreſſed the bonds of modeſty, their affections are inflamed and they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied: <hi>Annaeus Seneca</hi> in other things moſt wiſe, was in this kind faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when he with <hi>Byrrhus</hi> in an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perſwaded <hi>Nero</hi> to put his mother to death, for that they ſuppoſed that if

                  <note n="*" place="margin">46 Faſtus hic hodie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximo in uſu eſt.</note>46 <hi>This kind of pride is come in faſhion in our dayes,</hi> and is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by men of mean ranke and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Seneca</hi> excellently deſcribeth it, ſaying, That it is the property of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious proud man to ſtand much upon the going into his houſe, he hath an opinion that he doth highly honour thee, if hee ſuffer thee to goe into it before him; and it is obſervable that they which ſtand ſo much upon terms of honour in this kinde, are of this condition, That they will be ſingular, looke big, and never ſalute any man, ſpeak, walk, or eat with any man; their pride is to become like the man in <hi>Seneca,</hi> to make the pole Antar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick kiſſe their toe, and <hi>Cynthia</hi> to do homage to their Tayle; they talke of Kingdomes and their Fathers poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which being once attained, they

forget God, and all goodneſſe; the ſame <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Tragedy entituled <hi>Hercules Furens</hi> ſaith, that God at every turne meets with the proud man.</p>
               <p>Which ſaying as <hi>Philip Commines</hi> obſerves, <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in his mouth, where pride goes before, there ſhame followeth at the heeles: God reſiſteth the proud, and pride goeth before a fall; it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the proud man, that he ever hates one of his own condition, and omits no opportunity to do him miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; wherefore as at all times they are neglected and deſpiſed by ſuch as have any predominant power over them, ſo then eſpecially when they ſtand in competition for any honours and preferments; for as they are inſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and care not for the love of any, unleſſe it be to bring to paſſe their own deſignes; ſo on the other ſide no man cares for them; ſo that in times of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, the times of triall of true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they finde the fruits of their folly and arrogancy; men of this condition being put in places of command, ever abuſe the power committed unto them
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:154392:33"/>
to ſatisfie their greedy coveteouſneſſe, as we have ſeen in <hi>Sejanus, Narciſſus, Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> and ſome others, that they may pill and pole, and doe what they will, have ever opportunity; their friends being powerful, no requeſt is denied them; all men reſcue them, all men obſerve and obey them; their followers and attendants, are luxury, pride, pompe and prodigality, which ever add ſpurrs to their greedy deſires; for they muſt be maintained, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle will not do it. But if theſe were not, the minde of man is inſatiable; for co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteouſneſſe is of ſuch a nature, that it will never reſt content, full nor faſting, and therefore is juſtly ſaid to be the root of all evill, the thing that ſubverts honeſty &amp; all ſquare dealing between man and man; that occaſions pride, cruelty, neglect of Religion, and the ſale and ſhipwrack of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and as <hi>Saluſt</hi> affirmes<note n="*" place="margin">47 Avaritia bellua im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manis, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toleranda.</note> 47 <hi>it is a Beaſt inſufferable in a well govern'd Common-wealth,</hi> it depopulates Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, Villages, private Families, takes away the good name and reputation of a man, makes Religion a ſtalking

horſe to effect what it deſireth, and is of that power and efficacy that no Power, or Bulwarke, or Army, is able to withſtand it; it prevails with the Virgin to ſubmit her thoughts to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt deſires; it prevails with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to withdraw his affections from his Childe, and with the Childe to make him neglect his duty to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is a fault, and a great one in a meane man, but it is more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in him that is powerfull and mighty; wherefore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that their is no vice more hatefull in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſuch as governe the Common-Wealth, then Coveteouſneſſe; for to make ſale of the Common-Wealth is not onely diſhonourable, but wicked and unjuſt. Hence it is that theſe kinde of men are odious in the eyes both of Prince and People; who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they may tyranniſe and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the people, and by reaſon of their greatneſſe no man dares once o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his lips againſt them: yet God that ever takes the quarrell of the poore into his hands, and puniſheth wrong doers, will diſcover their devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:154392:34"/>
and bring them unto ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour: Their riches ſhall be made ſnares to intrap them, and like ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges chruſht together ſhall they ſend forth the water which they have ſo greedily ſuckt up. Another Vice which generally attendeth greatneſſe, is Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, which they uſe to keep Inferiours in awe, that they ſhould not dare to do any thing that tends to the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of their greatneſſe; their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is like <hi>Hamans,</hi> making of a Mountaine a Molehill; ſmall offences to be capitall, and puniſhing them with utter ruine and deſtruction; for theſe men having guilty Conſciences, never dream of virtue or honeſty, but ſeek by puniſhments to keep men in awe: Yea,<note n="*" place="margin">48 Dicta in ſe ulciſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> 48 <hi>they puniſh words againſt themſelves in a high degree;</hi> a Prince by forgiving of haſty words purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to himſelfe Fame and Renowne; but they, unleſſe they take revenge of their Enemies, have a conceit that the people conceive they are not in that grace and favour with their Princes as formerly they were; for example in this kinde wee may produce <hi>Joab,</hi>

who by treachery ſlew <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaſa,</hi> whoſe lives King <hi>David</hi> ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but what befell to <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Joab,</hi> no man is ignorant. Another ill quality that raignes for the moſt part in great men, is, that they reſpecting more their owne private then the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique good, lay heavy burthens upon the ſhoulders of the Subjects, and if they finde the Princes diſpoſition ſo to doe, they are ever putting him in minde of it; if not, they will adviſe him to it; if the Prince require one penny of the Subjects, they cry two; if he doe but threaten, they cry hang him; it is good they cry for a Prince to be terrible, inexorable, cruell; and for men of meane rank to be milde, liberall, and familiar; it is a tenet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them that is better to rule by feare, then by love; that it is lawfull for a Prince to doe what hee will; that every mans Eſtate is in his power; nay, with <hi>Polinices</hi> in <hi>Seneca</hi> they cry,
<q>
                     <l>The Prince that fears diſdainfull hate</l>

               <p>They enveigh againſt Parliaments, and uſe all means to bring the Prince out of love with them, and ſtudy how to hinder them, ever buzzing in his eares, that what is done there, is done for private ends, without any reſpect to the Common good. If the Prince make any wiſe and diſcreet Judges, they muſt preſently become their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, doe what they will have them, and keep nothing ſecret which they will have made known;<note n="*" place="margin">59 Diviſiones &amp; factio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</note> 49 <hi>they ſow diſſention, and maintain a Faction ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people,</hi> ſuppoſing that there is no better meanes to keep them in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience then this, for that one Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be ever ready to aſſiſt the King to ſuppreſſe the other, and be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to bring ſome griſt to their Mill; ſo that while they are buſied about their private injuries, they conceive
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:154392:36"/>
publique wrongs which concerne the Common good will never be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and ſo they themſelves by this meanes eſcape unpuniſhed: by their good will they will never ſuffer private quarrels to be taken up, or publique grievances to be fully redreſſed, that ſo occaſion may bee miniſtred of dayly attendances at the Court, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon them, whereby they may ſhew their power of ſuppreſſing the one, and ſupporting the other, as they take affection; for which reaſon they will not ſuffer the Prince to grant a pardon, but in ſpeciall caſes, to any Delinquent, but upon condition. In all buſineſſes between the King and his People, where their Councell is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they ſpeak ambiguouſly and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly, for they feare nothing more then that the people ſhould ſuppoſe that they doe not ſtand indifferent between the Prince and them. Such Councellours had <hi>Rehoboam</hi> King of the Jews, who when hls Subjects complained unto him of heavy burthens laid upon them by his Father, by the adviſe of his Councell, anſwered them, that his

little finger ſhould lie more heavy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them then all his Fathers body; my Father chaſtned you with whips, but I will chaſten you with Scorpions: ſuch a kinde of fellow was <hi>Nicholas Gara,</hi> a Count Palatine of the Kingdome of <hi>Hungarie,</hi> who being exceeding pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull with Queene <hi>Mary</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Lewis</hi> the firſt, gave his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell that ſhe ſhould not ſuffer her Peers to become too powerfull, as wee hear'd before; but how his Counſell took effect, I have before remembred, and what befell to the Councellours of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam,</hi> every one can tell: <hi>Sleidan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that <hi>William Poyets</hi> the French Kings Chancellour was by the Kings ſpeciall command taken out of his bed and caſt into Priſon, with the generall applauſe of the people; for that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the foure yeares that hee held his office he had offended all ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Such is generally the end of theſe ſort of people; for when the Prince is once fully informed of their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſatisfie the people, they puniſh them to their ruine and deſtruction.

Therefore it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if ſuch as have power to doe what they will, ſtanding in feare of none, become proud and inſolent, and have their imperfections made knowne unto the world; for being on high they can
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:154392:38"/>
do nothing but notice is taken of it, whereas if they lived in a mean rank, their faults would paſſe unregarded; our nature is ſuch; there is no good thing in the world but it abuſeth, but moſt of all the proſperity and good fortunes wee injoy: And why? becauſe our wils being prone to all wickedneſſe, our proſperity adds ſpurs unto it, and doth not onely move, but continually adminiſter occaſion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us to ſatisfie our unbridled luſts and affections.</p>
               <p>Such as have attained to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt favour with their Princes, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their daily familiarity with them, have in the end become moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and contemptible in their height. <hi>Sejanus, Tiberius</hi> onely minion for the time, for that he ſtiled himſelfe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and <hi>Tiberius</hi> governour of a poore Iſland, <hi>Tiberius</hi> hated and deteſted; the ſervant that hath beene delicately brought up from a Childe will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to himſelfe the priviledge of a ſonne at laſt, ſaith <hi>Solomon.</hi> For preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming upon the favour of their Princes, they make them the ſubject of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

neglect their commands, vilifie them, and mocke them, aſſuming the honour of what is done to themſelves, attributing nothing to the power of the Prince.

               <p>
                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports how that <hi>Pallas</hi> through his pride exceeding the bounds of a free man, drew hatred upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and how that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> for that hee ſlew <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> without his conſent, put <hi>Claudius</hi> into a kinde of a phrenſie, and made him in paſſion ſay, that <hi>Narciſſus</hi> durſt never attempt thoſe things upon his Wife, though ſhe had deſerved it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that hee had firſt deſpiſed her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.

Such another was the Earle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> that was Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> of whom I have ſpoken before, who upon all occaſions relying on the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Duke of <hi>Burgondy,</hi> and the King of <hi>England,</hi> would riſe in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt his Prince: and that his power and greatneſſe might ſtill continue together with his ſtipends from the King which were exceeding great, hee ever laboured to keep the King in Warr, that ſo he might be beholding to him to aſſiſt him when occaſion offered it ſelfe; for he together with his aſſociats did rather aime at their private good then the good of their Countrey. But theſe and the like deviſes, as they are moſt ridiculous in themſelves, ſo they are to none more pernicious then to the Projectors, as is manifeſted in the Hiſtory of the Conſtable before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, moſt exactly written by <hi>Philip Commines, Nicholas Picunnes</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the Army of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Millane,</hi> after that he had brought the Earle of <hi>Francisfort,</hi> and the Army of his confederates into ſuch a ſtraight, that he was aſſured of the victory, he
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:154392:40"/>
broke forth into ſuch a height of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolency, that forgetting himſelfe and the charge that was committed unto him, he calls to minde how long he had ſerved the Duke in the Warrs, and that during all that time he had not gotten ſo much land in his ſervice as would cover his body when he was dead; and therefore he began to expoſtulate what reward ſhould be given for all his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and becauſe it lay in his powet to deliver into the Dukes hands the whole Conntrey of <hi>Lumbardy,</hi> and all thoſe Enemies that did oppreſſe him, he required of the Duke as a reward for his ſervice the City of <hi>Placentia:</hi> the which unleſſe hee would grant, hee plainly told him he would return home and leave the field; this mans inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency ſo much offended the Duke, that rather then he ſhould have his will, he was content to leave an aſſured victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; ſo ſuffered himſelfe to be carried away with the inſolency of this man, whom no danger or feare of Enemies could ever move a jot: wherefore hee concluded Peace with the Earle, and commanded <hi>Pricinius</hi> with his Army
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:154392:40"/>
to quit the Country, accuſing fortune as a ſtep-dame, whereas there was no fault in her, but in <hi>Pricinius</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency.</p>

                  <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports of <hi>Lentulus Getulicus,</hi> being made Generall over the Army of the upper part of <hi>Germany,</hi> and being ſuſpected and accuſed by reaſon of the inward familiarity between him and <hi>Sejanus,</hi> was ſo bold as to ſend Letters unto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> ſhewing that the familiarity between him and <hi>Sejanus,</hi> was not occaſioned of his own head, but by the advice of <hi>Tiberius;</hi> and therefore it was nor ſtrange, but that he as well as <hi>Tiberius</hi> might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; neither could that be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him as an errour of wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for that he ever carried an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart to him, and reſolved ever ſo to do, though he had been often temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to quit his allegiance, and could endure no more to heare that <hi>Sejanus</hi> ſhould ſucceed in the Empire, then he could endure to heare of his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But in concluſion, <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Getulicus</hi> made a League as it were that <hi>Tiberius</hi> ſhould enjoy his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:154392:41"/>
and <hi>Getulicus</hi> his Province. <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirmes that the bold mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Epiſtles which <hi>Getulicus</hi> writ unto <hi>Tiberius</hi> did him no hurt at all; for <hi>Tiberius,</hi> wiſely conſidering in what caſe hee ſtood, how he was growen old, and not beloved of his Subjects, and that he had not power of himſelfe, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him alone of all <hi>Sejanus</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents to live in peace and enjoy his favour. But without doubt this did much trouble <hi>Tiberius,</hi> that was of a cholerick diſpoſition and a high ſpirit, and if hee had lived long, he would have called him to an account; but hee conſidered that <hi>Getulicus</hi> lived farr from him, and what hee writ procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the bottome of a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and out of an honeſt heart. There is another thing that doth commonly happen to ſuch as are grown proud with proſperity, that the ſame cruelty which they have without controule executed upon their equals and inferiours, in the end they execute upon their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign. Experience hereof we have in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Richard Nevill</hi> Earle of <hi>Warwick,</hi> who being highly advanced
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:154392:41"/>
by the King after that he had compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the death of the Queenes Father, her children and many others that were neare and deare unto the King, at laſt was not afraid to riſe in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the King; wherefore <note n="*" place="bottom">54 Ne quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piam ſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nimia poteſtate afficeret.</note> 54 <hi>Moecaenas wiſely counſelled Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus that he ſhould not ſuffer any of his Subjects to grow too great,</hi> leaſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould grow ſo powerfull as to dare to attempt any thing againſt him. There are others that carry themſelves more moderately, and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that relinquiſh the ſervice of their Prince that raignes, and follow and adore the riſing Sunne, apply themſelves to him that is to ſucceede in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as <hi>Macro</hi> did; but theſe kinde of people never continue long in favour; for by their behaviour to the former Prince, they are deſervedly had in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition by the later, and undergoe the puniſhment in his time which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in his praedeceſſours; perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they which ſaucily upbraid their Prince as <hi>Clytus did Alexander</hi> with what they have deſerved, are not ſo much to be condemned, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

that abandon their ſervice; yet it is moſt diſtaſtefull to a Prince to be told of any ſuch thing; for that they are more pleaſed in hearing what rewards they have conferred, then in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what any man hath deſerved.</p>
               <p>The deſerts of a Subject are ſo long acceptable to the Prince, as it is in the Princes power when hee will to come out of his debt; but when he thinkes he hath deſerved ſo much that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well requite him, then doth hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite him with perpetuall hatred; for this very cauſe did <hi>Adrianus Caeſar</hi> remove <hi>Tatianus</hi> and his fellow from their juriſdiction and government, to whom he was indebted as much as his Empire came to, as <hi>Spartianus</hi> ſaith; but it was imputed to their popularity; and if there were no other cauſe to make a man hatefull in the eyes of his Prince, this alone were ſufficient; for there is no Prince of ſo poore a ſpirit, or ſlender capacity, that will indure ſuch malepert fellowes; for it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ingrafted into Princes, not to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an equall or a competitor.

               <p>Fortune is alwaies fickle, and every thing that mortall men enjoy upon earth uncertain, as it is in the <hi>Comaedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and ſo much the more uncertain by how the greater a man is; the greateſt

honours are attended with the greateſt cares and feares; neither is there any ſtate more uncertain then the eſtate of great men; wherefore they have need when they have attained their wiſhed deſires, to pray to God to preſerve them in the ſtate which they have long deſired and prayed for.</p>
               <p>A chiefe cauſe hereof is for that the favour of Princes is ſubject to alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which <hi>Tacitus</hi> glanceth upon in the examples of <hi>Maecenas,</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtius</hi> before alledged, where he ſhews a twofold cauſe thereof: the one of deſtiny of which we have ſpoken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the other their own greatneſſe and fulneſſe, when the Prince hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them ſo much, that hee can give no more; and they receive ſo much that they can crave no more; then doth he eaſe them of the burthen (as <hi>Amiratus</hi> hath at large dſcovered) but the true cauſe thereof is for that Princes are men, and ſubject to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of men: and the minde of man is of a fiery nature and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon every light occaſion; for as the imagination of man will in a ſhort
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:154392:46"/>
time well conceive a thouſand ſeverall things, paſſe over a thouſand ſeverall places; ſo the minde of man will in a moment be of a thouſand ſeverall opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; therefore it is truly ſaid that the minde of man delighteth in novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Wherefore the French Knig <hi>Lewis</hi> the eleventh, after he changed his bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber, men and others, that waited upon him, was uſed to anſwer all ſuch as taxed him for it, that nature delighted in novelties; many other cauſes may be added as the naturall inclination and diſpoſition of man, and accidents which do often fall out, which doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and change the minde of the Prince: as <hi>Spartianus</hi> affirmes, that <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> the Emperour had an open eare to heare any thing that could be told him of them unto whom he profeſſed the greateſt love; wherefore all thoſe that he moſt affected and advanced to the higheſt degree of Honour, in the end he eſteemed no better then ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; ſo Henry the third King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> eſteemed of<note n="*" place="margin">57 Hugo de Burgo pro to juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is nothing that makes us more degenerate from our ſelves, and tranſgreſſe the lawes of God and men then ambition; it was not enough for him to enjoy the ſecond place of the Kingdom, but he muſt covet after the firſt; neither is it a marvell that he that of late would not endure an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall, ſhould not now admit of a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour; wherefote <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:154392:47"/>
unto the times, and betooke himſelfe to live upon his own Poſſeſſions; and it is ſaid that the Earle did much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud him for ſo doing: for that hee had learned by his own example, that the minds of Monarks are carried hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and thither in a moment, which <hi>Gerardus de Roo</hi> taking into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, commended the ſaying of him who compared the Minions of Princes unto counters with which wee caſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which being removed from place to place, ſtand ſometimes for much, ſometimes for little, and ſometimes for nothing. A cauſe likewiſe wherefore Princes doe withdraw their affections from their Minions, is, to give their Subjects ſatisfaction whom they have grieved and oppreſſed; examples where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have before alledged, unto which we may add the example of Duke <hi>Borgio Valentino,</hi> whom <hi>Nicholas Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivell</hi> hath remembred, who after that hee had reduced <hi>Flaminia</hi> to his obedience, hee made <hi>Remerus Orcus</hi> a cruell man and a great undertaker go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thereof, who ſo carried the matter, that in a ſhort time hee had
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:154392:48"/>
every man at his beck: yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a great deale of cruelty, which drew the hatred of all men upon him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Duke to winn their hearts againe, was faine to acquaint them that if any exorbitances were committed in <hi>Flaminia</hi> by <hi>Orcus,</hi> it was done of his own accord without his conſent or approbation; and ſo he took that occaſion early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to have his body divided into two parts, and girding a ſword by his ſide, with a wooden ſcabberd, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him to the view of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in the market place; which when the people ſaw, they went home every one well ſatisfied. Envy is ever an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of ſuch a man; and not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly; for whoſoever is advanced by meer favour, without any deſert of his owne, or approbation of the people, to have rule and authority o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver others of more worth, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will hate and deſpiſe; for the favour of a Prince is like unto a faire Virgin, whom many affect, and will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that ſhe ſhould looke more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably, walke or talke more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:154392:48"/>
with any then with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo that between men of this condition there is ſeldome or never any true friendſhip or familiarity; for up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every light occaſion they ſtudy how to bring one another in diſgrace. <hi>Tully</hi> well ſaith, there is no faith or friendſhip obſerved, when a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is at ſtake; for whatſoever is of that nature, that many may contend for, yet but one can injoy. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is great, but faith and honeſty little; hee that dotes upon one, ſeems to neglect all others. And hee is a very bold Prince (as <hi>Chriſtopher Beſoldus</hi> obſerves) that for the love of one will draw the hatred of the multitude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Examples hereof we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alledged in <hi>Nicolas Gara</hi> Count Palatine of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and in others: and during the raigne of the French King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond in <hi>Amiralius Comeſtabilius,</hi> and the Chancellour, who having attained to the chiefeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of honour, envied each others proſperity.

but if things ſhould ſucceed proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly the honour thereof would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound unto <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and not unto <hi>Antiochus;</hi> and that if fortune ſhould ſo favour <hi>Hannibal</hi> to overcome the <hi>Romanes,</hi> what hope could <hi>Antiochus</hi> have to expect that this man would be true to him, that was falſe to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? That it was ſafe for <hi>Antiochus</hi> to uſe him as a Councellour, but not as a Commander in the Warre?

Famous and worthy atchievements are ever attended with envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and it is the condition of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of a Country by their friends and allies to vilifie the acts of ſtrangers, and to ſtudy how to bring them into diſgrace and danger.</p>
               <p>To conclude, this one thing, that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:154392:51"/>
is to ſay, to take too great a burthen upon themſelves, and preſume with their owne wit and judgement to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and rule whole principalities, doth very much hurt theſe kinde of people; for if that one man though qualified with rare and admirable gifts of art and nature, cannot ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly carry himſelfe in the mannage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a buſineſſe of ſmall conſequence, but that hee ſhall deſerve reprehenſion of the multitude, and incurre the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of his Prince that laid that burthen upon him: how is it poſſible that one man ſhould mannage as hee ought, the ſtate of a Kingdome, which will trouble the heads of many men laid together? This <hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> found to bee true, who after that the Senate had ſetled him in the Empire, conſidering the greatneſſe thereof, and his owne weakneſſe, ingenuouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that the minde of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi> onely was capable of ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; as for himſelfe being called to bear but a part of it, he found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience how difficult and dangerous the burthen of a Kingdome was, and how
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:154392:52"/>
much ſubject it was to change and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therefore in a Citie where many able and deſerving men are, ſpeciall care is to be had, that one man beare not the ſway alone; for that many heads together will with more eaſe and ſafety mannage the ſtate and affaires thereof, which as it is moſt true, ſo I deſire that they eſpecially take notice thereof, who dare of themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to beare ſo great a burthen; for it cannot bee, but that theſe men which take ſo much upon them, muſt neglect to do many things which they ought to doe, and ſo deſerve a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion; it is a common ſaying, that no man can ſerve two maſters: Whence <hi>Plato</hi> in his eighth Booke of Laws, affirmes, that it is a moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing for a man, be hee of ever ſo good a wit and capacity, to excell in two ſeverall arts; ſo that <hi>Diodorus Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus</hi> ſaith, with the <hi>Indians,</hi> it is not permitted for any man to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to two ſeverall ſtudies.

Princes therfore in my opinion cannot think of a better meanes to avoyd the aforeſaid inconveniences, then not to ſuffer any one of their Subiects to grow too great, and to burthen him with too much power and authority; of this <hi>Moecaenas</hi> amongſt many other things admoniſhed <hi>Augustus Caſar,</hi> leaſt ſuch a man by reaſon of his power might attempt any thing againſt him; of this opinion was <hi>John Bodyn,</hi> who out of his own experience found it to be true that there is nothing more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to a Prince, then to ſuffer any one to come ſo neare him as to be able at one ſtep to ſtep into the Royall ſeat, and ſo far to excell others in authority that they muſt depend upon him; and this hee found to bee ſomuch the more dangerous when any one is permitted
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:154392:54"/>
to rule without an aſſociate, and to enrich himſelfe with the Treaſure of the Common-wealth; wherefore <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drianus Caeſar</hi> would never acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any of his freed men in publick, nor ſuffer himſelfe to be led by them; hee was uſed to ſay that all his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſours were too blame for liſtening ſo much unto them: and if any one had vaunted of the power hee had in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, it was a ſufficient matter to condemne him; wherefore Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ought to have in perpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:154392:55"/>
and fall away, for the Kings (whether by the ſubtilty of the Majors, or their own fatall idleneſſe it is hard to ſay) left the care of the Kingdome and government thereof unto them, and gave themſelves wholly to their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights; only once a yeare in the Calends of May they ſhewed themſelves unto the people; in the meanetime the Majors took upon them the Government of the Kingdome, ſummoned Parliaments, gave audience and anſwers to Ambaſſadours, made Leagues with forraign Princes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged edicts and decrees, and did all things as fully that did belong to the Kingly power as if they had beene Kings indeed; whence it came to paſſe, as the minde of man is inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that they began by degrees to make their way into the Kings Throne, to ſet them at defiance, and to drive them like Captives and Children into corners; and if the King had attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuppreſſe them, they with all their might and power had not been able to have done it; for they got the the whole power of the Kingdome into
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:154392:55"/>

ſuch others as I ſhall now acquaint him withall.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:154392:60"/>
good Souldiers nor good Councellors. It comes into my minde, that not long agoe I was told a ſtrange ſtory, that a certaine Prince writ that a Doctor of the law might be ſent unto him, whom he would uſe as his Councellour, and withall declared himſelfe how hee would have him qualified, that hee ſhould have a head able to carry his cups well; but for mine owne part I had rather have a ſober man to be my Counſellour; and if my judgement faile me not, I thinke there is no ſuch plague unto Princes, as to have about them theſe nimble undertakers, that dare adventure upon any imployment, eſpecially if they bee, as uſually they are, boaſters of themſelves. For theſe Polypragmons, for the moſt part, are never ſetled in any courſe, but are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes deſirous to try concluſions, and as the winde and tide doe ſerve, ſo doe they deſiſt their former courſes, and leave their maſters. Yet <hi>Livy</hi> writes, that <hi>Marcus Cato ſenior</hi> was ſo rarely qualified, that in what place ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he had been in he would have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a fortune out of it; in that he knew

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:154392:62"/>
to doe any thing of my owne head; but yet remember that it is your duty rather to obey then to perſwade. I ſay, I doe not allow of this, for a Prince wholly to rely upon the ſtrength of his owne wit, and to mannage every thing of himſelfe; but with <hi>Juſtus Lipſius</hi> I would have him to impart the cares of his Kingdome unto others, to obſerve the golden mean, not to ſit idle, and lay the burthen wholly upon others; but as the Governour of a Ship allots to every Mariner a proper office, whilſt he ſets at the ſterne and over-ſees them; and as a Generall in the Warre doth not alwayes fight, or take upon him the whole burthen of the War, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and enjoynes every one what he ſhall do: So I would have a Prince ſit at the ſterne, caſt his eyes every way, that he may ſee and know what every Servant and Counſellour of his doth, or at leaſt, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he ſeeth them, and knoweth what they do; the which, that Prince whoſoever he bee that ſhall perform, though it cannot be that a Prince ſhould ſee every thing, heare every

thing, and be preſent everywhere; yet the very conceit that he doth ſee and heare them, and is preſent with them, will make them to be more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant and carefull; and as the Son diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels the clouds, ſo will this conceit diſpell many ill thoughts out of their mindes, and hinder them to put in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution many ill counſells; therefore as the beſt and warieſt Husbands are not alwayes preſent with their Servants and workmen, but are about other affaires in the world, yet ſometimes ſtep in upon them on a ſuddaine, as the maſter of the Family in the Goſpell did; ſo a Prince ought to doe, when his ſervants think him ſafe enough, farre remote, recreating himſelfe in his pleaſures and delights, then to ſtep in upon them, and ſee how they behave themſelves. But when I ſpeake of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; I do not ſpeake of ſervants that ſerve him in a low place, for they have others which will over-ſee them, and if they doe not as they ſhould, will puniſh them; but ſuch as are neer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and ſerve him in high places, who as they have the higher power, ſo

ever to be mindfull of the great charge that is committed unto them, and not to think that God hath ſet them on high to doe nothing elſe but to follow their pleaſures and delights: but they muſt know as hee hath ſet them in degree above others, ſo their care muſt bee greater then others, and that one day they muſt give an account of their Stewardſhip, and of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge; it is their vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancy that keeps ſubjects in ſafety; their labour and travell that affords them eaſe and reſt and delight; they like ſtarrs in the firmament muſt ever be moving, yet not ſo much for their own good as the good of others, as <hi>Homer</hi> hath it in the ſecond book of his <hi>Ili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ads.</hi> Wherefore their thoughts ought ſometimes to deſcend to men of the loweſt ranke: for there is no man ſo meane in a Kingdom but in ſome kinde may bee able to doe him ſervice; and in this ſhall they follow the example of their Creator, who hath numbred the very haires of their heads; let them ever beare in minde the ſaying of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> the Emperour, that

               <p>When the Emperour <hi>Rodolph</hi> ſaw certaine young men that loved him, to bee ſequeſtred from him, in ſome indignation, ſaid, for Gods ſake ſuffer them to come unto me, for I am not therefore called to the Empire that I ſhould bee kept cloſe in a coffin. In this thing thoſe two Noble Emperours <hi>Ferdinando</hi> and <hi>Maxmilian,</hi> did not much ſwerve from him; for every day at a certaine houre they gave audience to the poore, and willingly accepted ſuch country preſents as they were able to bring unto them.

a poore ſervant, or rather as a ſlave, hither and thither at his pleaſure; for <hi>Iſaacius</hi> put in execution whatſoever hee commanded, who dying, the ſaid <hi>Iſaacius</hi> as if hee had been born rather to ſerve then to command, received into his favour a young boy that new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly came from Schoole, and preferred him to a very high place, who not only led the Emperour as the little Fiſh called Propompes doth the Whale whither hee would, but whole Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Souldiers beſides; but it is no wrong unto ſuch Princes ſo to bee wronged and diſhonoured, becauſe they are acceſſary to the wrong, and conſent diſpenſeth with and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way an errour; but the wrong indeed is as before hath been ſhewed, that it opens a gapp to let in the diſhoneſty of ſuch as are miſchevous into the Court, and adminiſters an occaſion to corrupt the manners of ſuch as are good, by meanes whereof the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth is miſerably afflicted, juſtice is trampled upon, and both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and future ages ſuſtaine loſſe by it, the Prince beares the blame of all,

him with ruine and deſtruction; for although God bee long ſuffering and gentle, yet when his wrath is once incenſed, nothing will appeaſe him; and be ſure of this, that God whom thou haſt ſerved and obeyed, will ſo aſſiſt thee that though thou mayſt for a time incurr the diſpleaſure of thy Prince, yet in the end thy innocency ſhall be made known to thy prayſe and glory, ſo that the Prince ſhall not only thank thee when hee ſhall know thy integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but ſhall commend and applaud thee; and this was <hi>Joſephs</hi> caſe, whom when his Maſter had made him Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of his houſe, and committed all things to his power and authority, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſollicited by his Miſtris to lye with her, he would not conſent, ſaying, how can I commit this great offence and not ſinne againſt God? who though hee was for a time by his Miſtris ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations wrought out of favour with his Maſter and caſt into Priſon; yer in the end by Gods aſſiſtance he was delivered, and where before he had but the Command of a private Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, hee was advanced to bee the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

So when the King of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi> commanded <hi>Sephora</hi> and <hi>Phua,</hi> the two midwives of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> to kill all the male children of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> as ſoone as they were borne, they fearing God, did not obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but kept them alive; for which God bleſſed them and built them hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.

enſued. Therefore let him as much as in him lies carry himſelfe uprightly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men, not ſomuch to avoid the calumnies of the envious, and the backbiter, or the diſpleaſure of the Prince, as to keep himſelfe in grace and favour with God; for it is the greateſt happineſſe to do no wrong to any.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:154392:75"/>

He that is thus reſolved will have a care never to adviſe his Prince to proceed in any diſhonourable action, but to doe that which tends to his honour, and the good of the Commonwealth. I deny not but that many an honeſt man is put to a great ſtrait oftentimes, in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes of this nature; for it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult thing, for a man to go ſo equally between honeſty and juſtice that are ſtrict and ſevere, and the licentious pleaſures of the Court, that hee doe not runne himſelfe aground either on the one ſide or the other.

full fraught with Wine, hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Prexaſpes</hi> ſonne to go beyond the threſhould of the doore, and to ſtand there, holding his left hand over his head; <hi>Cambiſes</hi> then bent his bow and ſtruck his arrow into his heart, which was the mark he ſhot at; and having ript up his body, ſhewed <hi>Prexaſpes</hi> his arrowes head, ſticking in his ſons heart, and looking backe upon him, asked him whether his hand was not ſteady enough, who anſwered, that <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe could not have ſhot more ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.

Therefore as far forth ss he is able let a Servant approach the preſence of his Prince with all dutifull reſpect, and in a due time: and then let him make no doubt but truth will prevayle, if it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not of ſpleene or bitterneſſe; an example hereof we have of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> with whom <hi>Maecenas</hi> was in ſpeciall grace and favour, and not ſo much for any thing elſe as for this, that when hee was tranſported with choler and fury beyond himſelfe, <hi>Maecenas</hi> would undertake him and bring him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe

               <p>This did much hurt <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> King of <hi>Luſitania,</hi> that dyed in <hi>Affrica,</hi> of whom <hi>Hieronymus Conneſtagius</hi> thus writes, In the mean time ſaith he, King <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> called his Captaines and Peeres together to adviſe concerning the removing of their tents, and when hee demanded of them what they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived concerning the matter, many were afraid to ſpeak their minds free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for although they thought it moſt convenient to ſayle to <hi>Laraceen,</hi> yet becauſe they ſaw the King was of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

               <p>Of <hi>Marcus Agrippa</hi> that was both powerfull with <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and beloved of the people, we have heard of before, and of <hi>Byrrhus</hi> whom we have likewiſe remembred, <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirmes that he is beloved ſtill in the City for his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which I would to God the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of our time would ſeek for; but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them have a certain fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, let them pardon me if I give them a true Epithite, that then they doe the offices of faithfull ſervants, if they can prevaile with their Prince to oppoſe their Subjects and people in every thing, if they can oppreſſe them, afflict them, vexe them, diminiſh their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and ſo bring all their eſtates if it were poſſible by one project into the Princes Treaſury, forgetting that by this meanes they make the Prince but a private man, no better then a Merchant or Uſurer in pilling and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

the People committed to their charge, for whoſe good God hath put all power and authority into his hands; but who receives good by this? the Prince is noe way enriched, or made more powerfull by it; for there is no ſuch fortreſſe to a Prince as the love of his Subjects: but this is done that they may divide the ſpoyle among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and that thoſe good men which ſtaud for the Common-Wealth being brought to diſgrace, they alone may beare the ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:154392:92"/>
to carry themſelves proudly towards their inferiours, and inſolently towards all men: and ſo by abuſing of them never attaine their hopes and deſires; for it is a very difficult thing for a man to bridle his affections, when he hath ſuch Inſtruments to ſpurre him on, ſo that he that accuſed <hi>P. Anteius</hi> unto <hi>Nero,</hi> told him the cauſe of his licentious courſe of life was his riches, which had undone many a man; for he that hath gotten the Eſtates of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny rich men into his hands, will eaſily be perſwaded that he is a Prince; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will put them in minde of that which <hi>Seneca</hi> heard from his enemies, that upon many of them that followed the Courts of Princes, their riches have drawn envy, upon many ruine and deſtruction; what a maſſy Eſtate did <hi>Seneca</hi> raiſe under <hi>Nero</hi> by his wit and learning within the ſpace of foure yeares? with what eagerneſſe did hee ſearch after Wils and Orphanes at <hi>Rome?</hi> how did he drayne <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Provinces adjoyning with his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive uſury? how did he endeavour to winn the love of the Citizens, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:154392:92"/>
in his Gardens, and houſes, to exceed, as if he had been a Prince? The ſame thing, that is for that he did not add bounds to his riches, but out of a Stoicall pride, which makes ſuch as are active turbulent, occaſioned <hi>Plautus</hi> his death. The ſelfe-ſame thing overthrew <hi>Valerius Aſiaticus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Claudius,</hi> of whom <hi>Soſibius,</hi> that brought up <hi>Germannicus,</hi> under a pretence of friendſhip gave the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour a Caveat, affirming that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates too great in ſubjects are prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to Princes. <hi>Dion</hi> obſerves, that he refuſed to accept the conſulſhip a ſecond time to the end, that he might enjoy his riches, and free himſelfe from envy, and danger; but that did him no good; his riches in the end occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned his ruine: many other Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hath <hi>Dion</hi> to that purpoſe; and <hi>Scipio Amiratus</hi> evidently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, that great fortunes, and eſtates, are as dangerous to great men, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame poverty is troubleſome to poor men: on the contrary ſide, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> obſerves, in extremity of ſickneſſe, <hi>Nero</hi> thought <hi>Memmius Regulus</hi> newly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:154392:93"/>
to be a Gentleman addicted to Peace, and Tranquility, worthy of the Empire; his courſe of life was out of the compaſſe of danger; it nothing availed <hi>Valerius Aſiaticus,</hi> as wee have a little before remembred, nor <hi>Seneca</hi> to doe as they did to avoid danger; nay, <hi>Seneca</hi> had done more warily, and wiſely, if ſo be he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his owne precepts, ſtopt the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of his immoderate deſires, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne to have made that cold and poor excuſe that it was no good manners to refuſe the curteſies of a Prince. A meane therefore as well in this, as in every thing elſe, is to be preferred, and the holy Prayer of King <hi>Solomon</hi> to be had in perpetuall remembrance. Two things have I required of thee, ſaith he, before I die, deny mee not them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from me vanity, and lies, give me neither poverty, nor riches; feed mee with food convenient for me, leſt I be full, and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord; or leſt I become poore, and ſteale, and take thy Name in vaine.

into narrow roomes, that ſo wee may not be ſubject, and expoſed to the ſpoiles and ſports of fortune; thoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are low, and little, and may be contracted into narrow roomes, are not ſo ſubject to the dangers of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, as thoſe that are high and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; hee is the happieſt man that is not in poverty, yet is a neighbour unto it. Againe, the ſame <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, that in this Sea of the World, there is ſuch a viciſſitude, and alteration of eſtates, that it cannot be but that hee that is full fraught, muſt bee aſſaulted with many ſtormes, and tempeſts; therefore his Counſell is not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; let them reduce their eſtates into a narrow roome, that the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of envy and malice may doe them no harme; hee that loves the golden meane, lives neither in a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dide Cottage, or golden Palace.</p>

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:154392:94"/>
by ſuch meanes do like a moth, or canker uſually conſume goods well gotten, and give occaſion both to Prince, and people to envy their eſtates; for although great eſtates, if well gotten, ought not to be hurtful, and prejudiciall to a man; yet a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle occaſion will perſwade a Prince, that ſuch eſtates joyned with authority, may prove dangerous unto him; for generally we doe not prye into mens actions, and obſerve what they doe, but what they are able to doe; but tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when I perſwade a man to obſerve a meane in the getting of an eſtate, that hath opportunity to exceed a meane, I ſpeake to a man that hath no eares; wherefore though hee reliſh not what I ſay, yet let him obſerve in the getting of his eſtate, the rule which <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca</hi> preſcribed the Philoſopher; if he have a deſire to have abundance, let him ſatisfie his deſires, yet let him not raiſe himſelfe by wronging, or ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any, in queſtioning them for their lives to gaine their eſtates, or by any ſordide or baſe projects, and then no doubt they will continue with

               <p>Againe the Councell that wee have given to the Prince, the ſame do we give to his ſervants, that hee would not take upon himſelfe the ſole Government of the Common-Wealth, which many doe ſeek with all eagerneſſe, being of <hi>Gneius Pompeius</hi> minde that would not end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

not containe himſelfe, and add bounds to his felicity; as being weary, ſaith hee, on the way by long travells, I would deſire reſt; ſo being grown old, and not able to mannage my eſtate, and undergo theſe cares that attend it, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſire that you would take it into your tuition, and command your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, that they would have a care of it for your benefit, and give mee leave to ſpend the remainder of my dayes in the Countrey with ſuch allowance as will keep mee from want; but <hi>Nero</hi> not contented with this, cunningly diſſembled his hatred in flattering termes; <hi>Seneca</hi> gave him thankes, and began to change his former courſe of life, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding any to come to viſit him, but his followers; ſeldome came into the City, kept his houſe, as if hee had been ſicke, or a ſtudent in ſome faculty; and when he ſaw he grew deboiſt, and to give himſelfe to all kinde of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that hee might be out of the reach of his envy, he deſired his leave that he might live farre remote in the Country; which being denied, he fei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

himſelfe ſick, and never came out of his Chamber; but how came it to paſſe, that doing as he did, he did not avoid the diſpleaſure of the Tyrant? and may not the remedy now preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed bee ſaid to be no remedy by the Example of <hi>Seneca?</hi> truly I will not ſay any thing that may derogate from the underſtanding of ſo wiſe a man, yet I muſt ſay what I think, that <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> either<note n="* 102" place="margin">102 Tardius hoc uſus eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>uſed the remedy too late,</hi> when <hi>Nero's</hi> anger was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt him, or that hee took not ſo fit a time as hee ſhould have done, to move <hi>Nero</hi> in it; or rather which I doe moſt incline unto, that what was done may rather be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his beaſtly cruelty, from which the moſt innocent man in the world cannot be ſafe, and againſt which no remedy may be preſcribed; therefore as we cannot finde many Princes of the world like unto <hi>Nero,</hi> ſo by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the remedy before preſcibed is not to be neglected, or condemned; but doe thou as <hi>Sylla</hi> the dictator did, as <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and many other Noble Princes of the

World have done; who of their own accord, without any ſuch cauſe moving thereunto, in the declining times of their ages, laid downe their Scepters, and retired themſelves. Doe thou I ſay provide for thine owne ſafety, add bounds to thy proſperity, and expect not fortunes comming to eaſe thee of thy burthen. Hiſtorians affirme that <hi>Polycrates</hi> a Tyrant of the <hi>Samnites</hi> lived happily, and enjoyed his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and preferments without any manner of croſſe all his life time; but <hi>Amaſis</hi> King of <hi>Aegypt</hi> did feare the end of him; for he was of opinion, that where there is no entercourſe, or change of fortune in the whole courſe of life, that the end will bee fatall; therefore his advice was, that if a man hath had no croſſes all his life-time, that he would afflict himſelfe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from that thing which hee moſt affecteth. This Counſell I would give unto them that are in power and authority, that they would volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily eaſe themſelves of that burthen; It is harſh I know, but yet it is good and wholſome Counſell, and not to be

neglected; and why? doe we not ſee that death is advantageous to many, whom ſhee takes away in the midſt of their proſperity; for had they lived they might have ſurvived their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe; wherefore <hi>Seneca</hi> adviſeth, that they that are moſt fortunate, in the very heighth of their fortunes ſhould deſire to dye, becauſe there is nothing certaine in this World, but that what is paſt.

and why they ſhould bee incapable of Magiſtracy, contrary to their ancient Cuſtome; but while they were thus parling, <hi>Miſogynes</hi> paſſing by, and hearing their diſcourſe, rudely ſteps in to them, and wiſht them to remember that they were not made to rule but to obey, that they were inferiour to men in every reſpect, that by reaſon of them men undergoe all the miſery in the World, that they are of themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Creatures, and for that cauſe every woman deſires to bee a man; that they are cold and timorous, and therefore not fit to undergoe the offices of the Common-Wealth; that if they ſhould bee admitted to any places of Command, and ſhould but once tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe the bounds of chaſtity, they would diſhonour themſelves and their places in perpetuity; when as the ſame offence in men is many times paſt by and ſoone forgotten; that men accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying them, become imperfect, and for that cauſe hate them moſt that had their virginity, and that women accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying men become more perfect, and for that cauſe love them beſt that had

theirs; which <hi>Philogynes</hi> hearing began to grow in choler, and plainly told him hee was in an errour, and that hee would make it plainly appeare unto him and all the World, that women (according to the naturaliſts) are no way inferiour unto men: for if they be, (ſaid he) it is either in reſpect of their ſubſtance or their accidents; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their ſubſtance it cannot be, becauſe they are both of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and (according to the Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) are a <hi>ſpecies</hi> comprehended under one and the ſame <hi>genus:</hi> and in reſpect of their accidents it is not, becauſe it muſt be either in reſpect of the accidents belonging to the body, or the accidents belonging to the minde: if by reaſon of the accidents belonging to the body, it is becauſe men are more ſtrong, more agile, and more laborious then women; but thats no reaſon: for that among men the ſtrongeſt are not in moſt eſteeme, but the wiſeſt; if by reaſon of the endowments belonging to the minde, it is becauſe men are more wiſe, more valiant, more temperate and more juſt then women; but that is no

reaſon, for that we may reade of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny women that have governed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes with as great wiſedome as men, to have been as excellent Philoſophers and Poets as men, to have led on Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the field as couragiouſly as men, to have decided controverſies in the Courts of juſtice as judiciouſly as men, and to have been as ſober and temperate in the whole courſe of their lives as men; yea which is more, if any preheminence bee to bee given con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the endowments of the minde, the woman is to have it, becauſe her fleſh is more delicate and tender, and according to Philoſophy, the more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the conſtitution of the body is, the more excellent are the endowments of the minde; for that the form followes the temperature of the body; and where you alledge that a woman is an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature without a man, you might as well ſay a man is imperfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a woman; for being that God made man and woman to encreaſe and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply humane generation upon the face of the earth, both are imperfect with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out each other; and to ſpeake the truth
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:154392:127"/>
the woman in that caſe is the more perfect of the two, and is to have the preheminence, if any preheminence bee to bee given, becauſe that man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genders with delight without any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the woman brings forth with ſorrow, and not without hazzard of life: and where you alledge that every woman deſires to bee a man, to the end ſhe may be more perfect, certainly you are deceived in the end; for they do not deſire it, to the end they may be more perfect, but to the end they may avoid that tyranny which men have uſurp't over them: and where you ſay that man is hot, and woman cold, and by how much heat is to bee preferred before cold, by ſo much is a man to bee preferted before a woman; it is true, heat is the more noble qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the two, if we conſider it in the elements as they are ſimple, but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it in the mixt bodies, there it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; for if cold cauſe women to bee timorous and fearefull which is a defect, heat cauſeth men to bee furious and frantick, which is an exceſſe, and it cannot bee maintained that a man that
